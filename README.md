# audiokit_01
AudioKit based visualizer concept written in Swift for MacOS.Currently a work in progress. Ideally i want to create a more complex visualizer, right now it is just basic code for separating the audio into channels and using the amplitude data for visuals. Might possibly use this project to build an iOS/MacOS app that would use Hue lights as the visualizer.
